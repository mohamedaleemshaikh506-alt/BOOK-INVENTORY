# BOOK-INVENTORY
Introduction
This activity involves developing a C program for a Book Inventory System using structures and arrays. The objective is to store book details (such as ID and price), sort them by price from highest to lowest, handle ties in price consistently (e.g., by sorting by ID in ascending order), and display the organized information. It illustrates key C programming concepts like structures, arrays, sorting algorithms, and user input/output. The program is practical for applications in libraries, bookstores, or inventory management, where organizing items by value aids in prioritization and decision-making.
Analysis
Requirements: The program must accept dynamic input for multiple books, store data in structures and arrays, implement sorting (descending by price with tie-breaking), and output formatted results. It should handle scenarios like varying numbers of books and ensure consistent ordering for equal prices.
Challenges: Sorting with ties requires a custom comparator to avoid instability. Using qsort from <stdlib.h> provides efficient sorting (O(n log n)). Data types (int for ID, float for price) balance precision and simplicity. Potential edge cases include zero books, identical prices, or invalid inputs (e.g., negative prices or non-numeric entries, which aren't fully validated here for brevity).
Design: The code is modular, with a dedicated comparator function for qsort. It emphasizes readability and efficiency, using standard C libraries. For robustness, input validation (e.g., checking for positive prices) could be added, but the focus remains on core functionality.
